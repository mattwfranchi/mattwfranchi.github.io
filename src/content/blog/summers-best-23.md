# Summer's Best Listens, 2023
Hi, readers! As I sit down to write this, I see the red Roosevelt Island shuttle drive over the Queensboro Bridge, reminding me that summer (and easily getting off this island) has ended. Since the F train has been shut down for a long stint of maintenance, I've picked up an annual CitiBike membership, which pairs well with my penchant for listening to albums front-to-back. 

So, in commemoration and reflection, as the sun begins to set before 7PM, I've compiled a list of my top musical consumptions from sweltering months gone by. Here's my list of the best listens of Summer 2023!

## Modjo - Modjo (2001)
**Genres:** French house, nu-disco, dance

You've probably heard 'Lady (Hear Me Tonight),' but have you heard 'Music Takes You Back' and 'Chillin''? Furthermore, have you heard a mix of 'Lady' and Daft Punk's 'One More Time' at the Box (read: somewhere you might get ketchup sprayed on your nice white shirt)?

## POiSON GiRL FRiEND - MELTING MOMENT (1992)
**Genres:** Dreampop, atmospheric, art pop

The string arrangement on "HARDLY EVER SMILE(without you)" is simply sublime.

## Arca - KiCK i (2020)
**Genres:** Avant-pop, electronic, deconstructed club

Before this album, my only encounter with Arca was through their production work on Bjork's *Vulnicura*, which contains one of my favorite tracks of all time -- "Stonemilker". Arca's music is an acquired taste, characterized by its frenetic and experimental nature. "Time" reminds me of the wisftulness of "History of Touches" from *Vulnicura*, while "Riquiqui" stands out as a unique experiment, with Arca collaborating with an AI startup to produce [100](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bd81d2yQGiDRzckcQ42dr?si=fZVTfh4MRrqENjm8eZonhQ) alternative versions of the track, each featuring distinct arrangements and beats.

## Christine and the Queens - Tears can be so soft (2023)
**Genres:** French pop, synthpop, electropop

I must confess, I haven't quite managed to sit through this entire album. Nevertheless, "Tears can be so soft" is one my favorite tracks of the year; I've never encountered something that makes descriptions of loss seem so empowering. With Mike Dean (of Kanye West fame) taking on a prominent role in the production, the album boasts a rich sonic landscape characterized by resonant basslines, warm synths, and dynamic range.

## Amaarae - Fountain Baby (2023)
**Genres:** Afrobeats, R&B, pop

Album of the year! Imagine the vocal baby of Kate Bush's early years and Doja Cat, fused with captivating live instrumentation and a sprinkle of queer, and you have *Fountain Baby*. Tracks like 'Disguise,' 'Angels in Tibet,' and 'Sex, Violence, Suicide' are personal favorites.

## 808 State - ex:el (1991)
**Genres:** Acid house, sound collage, techno

This album solved my month-long quest to unearth music reminiscent of an early Tekken soundtrack. Its raw energy and live instrumentation, coupled with vocal samples like "Big and strong like a lion!" make it a refreshing departure from the typical electropop soundscape of the 2010s and 20s. Standout tracks include 'Empire,' 'Leo Leo,' and the great opener 'San Francisco.'

## Allison Goldfrapp - The Love Invention (2023)
**Genre:** Synth disco

Sultry synth-pop that evokes the feeling of emerging from the West Fourth Street subway station after-hours on a Thursday. Personal favorites from this album include 'Gatto Gelato' and 'Love Invention.'

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/042rZgYJ5J3oTscBwQ8PPD?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Daft Punk - Discovery (2001)
**Genres:** French house, nu-disco, dance

 Dear friend [Anna](https://www.instagram.com/annaloganmc_/) put me on to this album. Much like how most have probably heard "Hung Up" from Madonna's [*Confessions on a Dance Floor*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1hg0pQJLE9dzfT1kgZtDPr?si=s4C8KFk7QqKq9CEkObnN9wb), most have likely encountered *Discovery's* most famous single, "One More Time". Other tracks like 'Face to Face' and 'Aerodynamic' are also standouts.

## Troye Sivan - Rush (2023)
**Genres:** House, dance, pop

When I first listened to *Rush*, I immediately drew sonic comparisons to one of my all-time favorite songs, Fleetwood Mac's [*Big Love*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LYlKd8cANn3CBpfaKlNLg?si=4ad06bc126c64ee4). I also really liked the choreography in this song's accompanying music video.
