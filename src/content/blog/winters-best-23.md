  My favorite sonic finds from the winter of 2023. 
---

This past winter was marked by transit droughts, slipping and sliding, and putting successively more tape around the headband of my Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones that I've had since senior year of high school. Sonically, I spent a large part of the winter developing a collaborative playlist with my dear friend Annette, dubbed *earth & moles*; this promoted a rare shift from album-based listening to playlist-based listening. All said, here are the selections that most defined my December, January, Feburary, and March. 

## Bjork & Mark Bell, *Alarm Call - Potage Du Jour* (1998)
I've a fascination with the things I can barely remember. The things your mom and dad loved when you were an early child; some you distantly remember, and some that give you a jolt upon a chance rediscovery. This means I am extremely fond of the 1996 film, *Twister*, the  Namco Museum Playstation game, and Little House on the Prairie. Indescribely (meaning, I honestly cannot verbalize why, I tried!), this song evokes those feelings for me. And, well, I do enjoy a soup of the day.

## Kelela & collaborators, *RAVE:N, The Remixes* (2024)
I read a comment about Kelela a few days ago: to remix your own songs is high-class musicianship.

## Bjork, *Sod Off* (1997)
Did Bjork write this for that reporter in Thailand? I appreciate the dramatic three-chord strings of this piece, and I admire the frankness with which Bjork describes setting boundaries; it seems like a headstrong and youthful expression of the same sentiments expressed in *Stonemilker*, a song on an album she recorded almost 20 years later.

## Shygirl & collaborators, *Club Shy* (2024)
Sometime right after the rollout of this Extended Play (EP)'s second single, *f@kâ‚¬*, I read a bit from an interview where Shygirl said this EP was meant to sonically convey a shift from the *blue* hues of her debut album, *Nymph* to warmer, red tones. This was super interesting to me as someone who often associates different types of genres, keys, and instruments with different colors and temperatures. I feel like Shygirl generally achieves this through incorporating instantly-recognizable club beats (which I associate with a hot, sweaty club) and more major-dominated keys, especially in *thicc*, the lead single. (Also, look at the cover). No skips on this Extended Play, in my humble opinion.

## Kali Uchis, *Red Moon in Venus* (2023)
This album rarely misses; particularly, *Moral Consciousness* is my favorite song of all I encountered during the winter period, although I derived extra satisfaction via overlaying the perspective of a spurned lover. Turns out, Uchis wrote the song about family drama (via Spotify's "Storyline" feature). Continuing a large theme of this article, apparently, most of the songs are in quite 'warm' keys like A flat minor, G flat minor, and B flat major (an addendum: I'm not sure if most think  of these keys as 'warm'; just my personal opinion).

## Eartheater, *Trinity* (2019)
In case you couldn't tell, I quite love warm-sounding synths, and this album is full of them. *Preservation*, in particular, is a sweltering, delirious fever.

## Dua Lipa & Danny L Harle, *Houdini - Slowride Mix* (2024)
Similar to Eartheater's *Preservation*, this Danny L. Harle remix of Dua Lipa's lead single of *Eternal Optimism* features some amazingly warm synths. It also has appeal for me by taking the punch of the original version of "Houdini" and slowing it down to a more sultry pace.

## Aphex Twin, *Selected Ambient Works 85-92* (1992)
Only in the past year have I really been able to pick up instrumental tracks. This started with 90s house variants from 808 State, Chicane, and Opus III, and then moved into more ambient & experimental offerings from Aphex Twin. *Xtal* is one of the warmest songs I've ever heard.

## Maurice Ravel, *Gaspard de la nuit, I. Ondine* (1908)
The whole *Gaspard de la nuit* suite is one of my favorites ever, and I had the chance to see Behzod Abduraimov play it live at Carnegie Hall in January. It feels entirely introspective, and yet also sonically reminiscient of an explorative epic like *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*.

## Wham!, *Last Christmas*, (1984)
How is it possible that the synthesizers in this Christmas holiday song emit such warmth and loss at the same time? For me, this song is always a large stimulus behind end-of-year introspection; but, I'm not really listening to the words.

In parting, I can only say that warm synths counteract the freeze.
