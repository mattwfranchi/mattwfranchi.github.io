  Sheet music and a short background of the writing process behind my piano composition, Arbor.

This is the very first song I've scored by hand, so pardon any idiosyncracies! This song has been in my head for about a year, and very much takes themes from my late father. It's a wistful song, yes, but the primary focus is on **stages**; that is, stages of grief, stages of life, stages of achievement, and so on. The song features three distinct sections that subsequently developed in my head over the past year, as I continued to revisit my thoughts and the composition.

**Arbor** is a nod to my dad's career in forestry and his love for nature, which diffused onto me, especially in recent years. I'm excited to share this piece with you all! I've decided to release the sheet music first, as an exercise in 'did I make this correctly?'. Signing off, x
