this requires Apple Music. 
But, download djay on the App Store, go into classic view, hook up your favorite running playlist, set the tempo to whatever you run at (for me, 140BPM on longer runs), press the “sync button”, and then start an automix. The app will speed up or slow down each song to your chosen BPM, and, all of a sudden, you get an energy burst from running to the beat of your favorite music.
